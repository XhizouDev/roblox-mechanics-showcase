## 🗂️ Code Organization

For clarity and maintainability, each script is tagged in its filename to indicate the project it belongs to:

- **[PA]** – Pantharas Age
- **[CMC]** – Cruzaders Madness Classic
- **[CMR]** – Cruzaders Madness Remastered
- **No tag** – Shared or project-agnostic systems

---

## 🎯 Context

All projects were developed independently as design, programming, and prototyping exercises, with a focus on:

- Modular Architecture within Roblox
- Reusable Systems and Tools
- Optimization and Scalability
- Gameplay Design and Player Experience

These projects emphasize gameplay programming and systems-oriented development rather than content production.

## 📏 Project Timeline & Skill Progression

All projects included in this repository were developed several years ago as part of my early-to-mid professional growth as a gameplay programmer and game designer.
The most recent project showcased here was **discontinued in 2023**, and active development on these systems has since ended.

Since that time, I have significantly improved my scripting skills, architectural decision-making, and overall technical approach to gameplay systems.

This repository should therefore be understood as a historical technical showcase, illustrating my foundations in system-driven game development rather than a direct representation of my current technical level.

## 📌 Final Note

This repository is oriented as a **technical portfolio**, not as a commercial project.
Some assets were omitted or simplified for code clarity.

Each project includes its own Markdown documentation page; please refer to them for detailed breakdowns of systems and implementation.
